            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
            <p>
                Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.
                Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world.
                In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, 
                as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. 
                Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. 
                The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. 
                It currently offers 20 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, Fade and Harbor. The player will get 5 unlocked agents 
                 (Brimstone, Sova, Sage, Phoenix and Jett) and will have to unlock the agents by activating that agent's contract.
            
            <h1>Unrated</h1>
           <p>
            In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. 
            The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). 
            If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.
            If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point.
            If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point.
            If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive matches. Additionally, 
            if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender. If the vote reaches 4 (in contrast to 5 for competitive), 
            the winning team gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them to 13, with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit.[11] A team gets only three chances to surrender: once in the first half, 
            once in the pistol round of the second half, and once more in the second half.
            </p>

            <h1>Competitive</h1>
            <p>
                Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. 
                Players are required to reach level 20 before playing this mode. In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition for competitive matches, 
                where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. 
                Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, 
                players may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw. The competitive ranking system ranges from Iron to Radiant. 
                Every rank except for Radiant has 3 tiers. Radiant is reserved for the top 500 players of a region, and both Immortal and Radiant have a number associated to their rank allowing players to have a metric in which they can compare how they rank up to others at their level.
            </p>
            <h1>Deathmatch</h1>
            <p>
                The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020.
                 14 players enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. 
                 Players spawn in with a random agent as well as full shields, and all abilities are disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay. Green health packs drop on every kill, 
                 which reset the player to maximum health, armor, and give an additional 30 bullets to each of their guns.
            </p>
            <h1>Replication</h1>
            <p>
                The Replication gamemode went live on May 11, 2021.
                During the agent select, players vote on which agent they would want to play as.
                At the end of the time, or after everyone has voted, the game randomly selects one of the player's votes. 
                The entire team will then play as that agent, even if one of the players has not unlocked that agent. It is a best of nine, 
                with the players switching sides after the fourth round. Players can buy guns and shields with a pre-set number of credits. 
                Abilities are pre-bought. Weapons and shields are reset every round.
            </p>
